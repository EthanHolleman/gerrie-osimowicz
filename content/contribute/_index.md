Geraldine was a part of many lives and we are collecting images from her
friends and family to include in her memorial that might have remained in
individual collections otherwise. If you would like to contribute you can upload
images by [clicking this link](https://forms.gle/wWCXn3Zcr9c4Y2Hk9) and completing
the form. 

You can also optionally include a short description of the image and 
the approximate date it was taken. This will be helpful in organizing submit 
images for the memorial. 

If you have any problems uploading or have additional questions please feel
free to each out to Ethan Holleman at 8479225317 or etholleman@ucdavis.edu.

You can also send images or other media directly to Michelle Holleman through her email
at michelleholleman@hotmail.com.

Thank you.
