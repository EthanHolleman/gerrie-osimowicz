# Words of Remembrance for Geraldine Harriet Osimowicz

#### By Michelle DeMars Holleman

Thank you everyone who has joined us today to honor Geraldine “Gerrie” Harriet Osimowicz a caring daughter, sister, aunt, and friend. She passed on May 22, 2021, at the age of 88.

I want to take a few minutes to reflect on Gerrie’s remarkable life.

October 26, 1929, Sigmund Osimowicz and Harriet Zielinski, married and started a life together. By all accounts, their marriage party was legendary with a band playing in the basement on Wood Street and spilling out into the streets. It was a joyful celebration, just days before one of the most devastating events in world history, Black Tuesday, on October 29, 1929, when Billions of dollars were lost in the stock market, and in the aftermath America and the world spiraled downward into the Great Depression which lasted until 1939.

Sigmund and Harriet, moved Harriet’s family home a two-flat with a basement apartment at 2026 North Wood Street. They lived in a one-bedroom apartment on the top floor, and Harriet’s brother Paul lived downstairs, and mother Marciana in the basement – her husband died young, in 1927 of heart failure and Harriet took care of her mother for more than 30 years, until Marciana died in 1958. Geraldine Harriet Osimowicz was born in the middle of the depression, on June 7, 1932. Ziggy was an upholsterer and warehouse clerk, and Harriet a hairdresser who became a homemaker.

Four years later they welcomed their son Richard, on September 27, 1936, and the following year, Gerrie entered Drummond Elementary School, the school where her father and siblings attended, and now her Grace her grand nice and Grant her nephew now attend. In 1942 when Geraldine was 10 -- Harriet gave birth to unexpected Twins, Larry and Lorraine, and while their family expanded, their space did not. At age 10, Geraldine found herself sharing a bedroom with

her brothers and sisters, until Zig turned the back porch into a bedroom for the boys and Lorraine and Gerrie shared a bed and a bedroom.

As a big sister, Gerrie helped to raise Larry and Lorraine, serving as a sister and playmate for the twins and helper for her mother.

Growing up, Gerrie was very social, and had a close group of friends from the neighborhood, and she enjoyed outings and parties. She graduated in 1950 from Tuley High school. As a young woman in “the old neighborhood” she bucked a trend in not marrying right out of high school. Instead, she enrolled in business school, and studied to be an executive secretary. She graduated in 1952 and joined the workforce, eventually landing at McCann Erickson (Today part of the Interpublic group one of the world’s larges agencies) in a coveted position as an executive secretary.

If you’ve ever watched the series MadMen, you have an idea what this world was like – the series was based on the 1960s advertising agencies – and McCann was one of the most storied agencies in history. Their clients included Coca Cola and Miller beer – they were the top of the world business – and this was a tough business. The hours were long, the pay wasn’t great, and it was about as sexist as it comes – today what we call harassment was just a part of the job. Yet amidst this backdrop, Gerrie thrived. It was at McCann that she first met David Heftner, an executive, and she earned his trust and became his right hand. She would never have another boss.

During this time, Gerrie left home, moving to an apartment on the Gold Coast at 10 West Elm, and walking to work on Michigan Avenue or taking the bus which was a her lifeline – as she never owned a car. Gerrie fit the role of an executive secretary at the time. She was always impeccably dressed and groomed. She understood the importance of appearance and never left the house without her hair and makeup done, fully accessorized.

When McCann reorganized in 1973, they laid off many employees, including Dave Heftner and Gerrie. Armed with three months of severance pay, Heftner invited her to join his fledgling firm, Marcoa, was a compression of the Marketing Company of America. Gerrie was the third employee of this new enterprise, and Hefner relied on her to do everything from finding office space to hiring and managing their payroll. The hours were long, the work challenging, and in this environment, Gerrie thrived.

Dave Heftner was a visionary – he understood something that few in the advertising world did at the time – and he worked to build a business based on direct marketing to consumers. In the advertising world, until the 1970s, direct marketing was left mainly to catalogs and retail businesses. The big agencies made money from ad buys, television, radio, billboards – but not from direct selling – so there wasn’t much incentive to pursue direct marketing. Heftner saw this as a gap – and he worked to build the worlds’ first full-service agency focused on direct marketing at Marcoa.

It was a good bet – and the agency grew rapidly. The 1960s advertising culture continued into the 1970s and by Gerrie’s account there were many days when their “lunches” turned into parties at the bar – the three-martini lunch wasn’t a cliché, but a reality. Gerrie chain smoked and drank vodka on the rocks. She became close with Tony Saratelli, a local bartender and later bar owner, who became like family to her.

She became a key employee at the company, growing in responsibility as the agency grew. Their most famous clients included Playboy, Allstate, Amoco, and Xerox. They had an office at 10 S. Riverside Plaza in Chicago, and Gerrie had an office overlooking the city. I remember visiting her when we were young, and seeing her sitting at her desk in her black suite with white pipping, cigarette in hand, oozing confidence, she was the epitome of what I imagined an executive to be. What I didn’t understand were the obstacles she overcame to get to that point.

In 1978 as Marcoa celebrated their 5th anniversary, Gerrie bought her first and last home, a condo at 2626 N. Lakeview, unit 1504, overlooking Lincoln Park, the Lake, and the Skyline. It was a 44-story luxury building with a 24 hour doorman, pool, and rooftop deck – and it remained her home for her entire life. The 151 Sheridan was her lifeline and she rode the bus to work every day. Gerrie was one of the original owners when the building converted to condos, and she never tired of her view. She hosted family gatherings, and I remember the excitement of visiting her in the city – and the anger of the residents who lamented the fact that we would get in the elevators and press all the buttons. It was glamorous and exciting to visit her in the city.

Marco continued to expand and grow, and in 1983 they were bought out by one of the world’s largest agencies, BBDO – and in 1986 became part of Omnicom group when several large agencies merged. Marcoa became the Marcoa DR group, with Dave Heftner as President of the Chicago office and the once tiny

fledgling organization was billing $100 million a year. The 80s were a heady time as Gerrie navigated mergers, acquisitions, and countless deals and changes. She bought a fur coat, a set of china, gold jewelry, and traveled the world with her brother Larry visiting Poland and the USSR. She enjoyed her role and relished being an executive at the center of it all. Ironically, she didn’t enjoy receiving junk mail – she would stand at her mailbox and toss out all of the direct mail pieces she received before even bringing them up to her apartment.

Gerrie was their controller and eventually a vice president, an essential employee who oversaw the financial operations and continued to serve as Heftner’s right hand. She had a business-school education, but she survived in this cutthroat environment until 1989 – when Marcoa merged with Rapp Collins to form the world’s largest direct marketing agency. The new agency, Rapp Collins Marcoa consolidated, and Gerrie, who had survived countless mergers and acquisitions, negotiated her exit in 1989.

It had been a remarkable run – and she beat the odds, a woman in a man’s industry – with a business school education, rose to become a vice president at one of the world’s largest advertising agencies. And she did it remaining true to herself. She was straightforward, plainspoken, stubborn, smart, and strategic – all traits that could get you fired easily -- but Gerrie leveraged her skills and became an example for all of us.

About the time she retired from Marcoa, Gerrie’s parents began to decline, and she devoted much of her time caring for them. She was close to her parents throughout her life -- although you might not have known it if you listened to some of her more spirited “conversations” with her dad. For Gerrie and Zig, argument was the most basic form of conversation – and they would debate constantly. Gerrie kept up on news and current events – and read the newspaper every day – and never hesitated to share her views.

Gerrie had a tough outer shell – necessary to survive in her career – but underneath, she was our Aunt Gerrie – who cared for her parents and was a constant presence in all of our lives. While she didn’t marry – she had nine nieces and nephews and 19 grand-nieces and nephews for whom she loved deeply. Our pictures lined her dresser until her last days on earth. She remembered every birthday, Christmas, and graduation. She always sent cards and handed out checks, and she cherished every card and letter she received. She babysat, spent weekends helping out her brothers and sisters, and took care of her parents. She looked forward to trips to Minnesota and traveling with Larry. She spoke to

Lorraine every day at 10:00 a.m. and remained close to her little sister until the very end.

She lived independently all her life and her independence was critically important to her. She remained in her condo at 2626 until the very end, and it looked much the same as it did when she bought it. Growing up as a child of the depression, Gerrie was frugal, knew what she liked, and didn’t see much point in changing anything. Ironically, a woman who made a career navigating mergers and change in her business life, remained loyal to the things she valued in her personal life. She only needed one hairstyle, makeup, condo, career, boss, family, and name. She remained true to herself -- -principled, maybe even stubborn to the very end.

A fall in the shower led to a broken hip and her decline – and it was a sad way to see her life end. But in the end, Gerrie remained independent until her 88th year on earth. She made her own choices, and that was most important to her. She never moved to a retirement home – she was happy at home and valued living alone. She understood that at some point she might need assistance, and she entrusted Karen with her care. I want to recognize Karen for all that she did to preserve and protect Gerrie’s independence in these past few years. Karen has worked tirelessly to support Gerrie and respect her wishes, and we owe her a great debt of thanks.

When I visited her last Thursday, I sat and talked to Gerrie about the incredible life she had and shared the influence she had on all of us. She wasn’t very lucid, as her time on the earth was coming to a close. Thinking letting go might be hard for her – I shared that it was ok to let go, that Dick, Terry, her father and mother for whom she had been calling for were waiting for her. And Gerrie, who hadn’t been particularly responsive to this point – looked at me and clearly said – “of course they are.” It was the perfect Gerrie moment – true to herself at the very end.

Lorraine visited her on the Friday before she passed, and her last words to Lorraine were “I love you always.” And she did. Gerrie demonstrated the importance in family and love. We say goodbye to her today, recognize her life well lived, remember the examples that she set and the trails she blazed, and leave her with those same words, Gerrie, we love you always.

Godspeed.
