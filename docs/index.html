<p>Geraldine “Gerrie” Harriet Osimowicz was a caring daughter, sister, aunt, and friend. She passed on May 22, 2021, at the age of 88.</p>
<p>Born to Harriet and Sigmund Osimowicz on June 7, 1932, Gerrie was a lifelong resident of Chicago.
She attended Drummond Elementary and Tuley High School before graduating from business school.
She had a long and successful career in advertising.
At a time when few women were permitted beyond entry-level positions,
Gerrie worked her way up the corporate ladder and ultimately retired as
Controller at Marcoa Direct Advertising, a company she helped found.</p>
<p>Fiercely independent, she loved her Lincoln Park condo and never tired of the
spectacular views. She enjoyed cooking, dining with friends, and travel. Her
favorite destinations included family fishing trips to Minnesota and
adventurous trips to Europe including Poland and communist Russia.</p>
<p>Most of all, Gerrie loved and took care of her family. She remembered birthdays
and cherished every card, letter and picture she received.</p>
<p>She was preceded in death by her parents, Harriet and Sigmund Osimowicz; her brother,
Richard Osimowicz (Evie); and brother-in-law, Terrance DeMars (Lorraine).</p>
<p>She is survived by her sister, Lorraine DeMars (nee Osimowicz); her brother,
Lawrence (Dorothy) Sims; and many nieces, nephews, grandnieces and grandnephews.</p>
